## HEPA 13 Filter

Use HEPA 13 filters from 10mm to 18mm thick. The best is to find a HEPA 13 filter for vacuum cleaner and cut it with a cutter. The references change according to the country.

I tested this one after cutting: 

- The best but I do not find the reference in other countries: [Amazon.fr](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01MCTSXVR)
